               <h6 class="mb-3"><mark class="mark-yellow-story">it's just the story of why I want to work as a developer</mark></h6>
               <p class="f-14">I love computers <span class="w-600">since I was a kid</span>, even when I didn’t have one of my own. Everytime I went to a friend’s house, and they had a computer I would spend hours on it. I don’t know how I learned that, it was just something natural. I knew exactly what button to press or how to use a mouse.</p>
               <p class="f-14">I begged my father for years to buy me a computer, but he refused everytime. Finally when I was 19, with <span class="w-600">my first job</span>, I got a computer of my own. 
                Windows millenium was its OS but since it was so bad, I changed it to <span class="w-600">win98</span> and I love it! I remember I felt such a <i>"hacker"</i> the first time I learned how to change the image that said: “You can turn off your computer now”. That’s when I started to learn a lot <span class="w-600">on my own</span>. The internet was still dial-up at the time, but I managed to learn all that I always wanted to and some more.
                </p>
                <p class="f-14">First I put all my efforts into image editing with photoshop and some other programs. Then by 2002 I started learning <span class="w-600">Flash</span>, and <span class="w-600">Dreamweaver</span> <i>(they still belonged to macromedia, remember that?)</i> and what I enjoyed most of <span class="w-600">websites</span> is that everything I created could be seen by my friends and family.</p>
                <p  class="f-14">During that period of time, <span class="w-600">programming</span> caught my attention. A friend taught me some <span class="w-600">Visual Basic</span> code using excel editor, and then he installed some version of VB in my computer and I kept on learning on my own.
                    I got to use my abilities one time, when I was working in a call center and I found it difficult to keep track of all the information the customer gave me during the call, so, with the help of my friend, developed a <span class="w-600">little program</span> that guide me through the call, completing every answer to the question I was supposed to ask and save all that information into a text file. The little program was a real success and my coworkers and supervisor started asking me to share it with them. Of course I did, it really made everyone’s work easier, and we all reached full bonus each month thanks to that.
                    </p>
                <p  class="f-14">By that time I have already learned how to format a PC and clean it, connect and disconnect hard disks (slave or master mode), remove or add a video cards and changing the power source. One time I got <span class="w-600">the blue screen error</span> <i>(Win98)</i> and I knew the cooler was about to die. It was a Sunday, no stores were open and I really wanted to keep using the computer so, I open the CPU an put a fan straight to it. It worked! It didn’t solve the problem, I know but it allowed me to continue until the next day.</p>
                <p  class="f-14">Around 2006 I continued to create websites in flash, but I wanted to do a little more so I took a course on <span class="w-600">ActionScript</span> to have better animation on them and by 2008 I created one to show all that was able to do. It was a sort of portfolio of hobbies. Unfortunately, I stopped paying for hosting so the site is no longer online.</p>
                <p  class="f-14">I created a few more sites in flash and dreamweaver, but as work comes first, I didn’t have the time to fully learn about new technologies, so I dedicated my spare time to write a <span class="w-600">blog</span> about something I knew quite a bit: <span class="w-600">Photoshop</span>. I wanted to give something back given the fact that I’ve learned everything from the internet. The blog contained many PS tutorials, english and spanish. Some of them were even <span class="w-600">sold</span> to other web sites. I was able to keep it for a year or so, and then again work had to be a priority, no time for hobbies.</p>
                <p  class="f-14">After that, social media took over, I dedicated my free time to make videos or pictures to post, but didn’t created any more websites. I realized that <span class="w-600">technology has exceeded me</span>. I felt a bit frustrated because there was so much to learn, and I didn’t have the time to do it. I knew I could learn by myself, but where to start? How? Everything changed so fast. I was feeling so old!</p>
                <p  class="f-14">And then <span class="w-600">smartphones</span> were a thing, I couldn’t help myself, I needed to know how apps worked. I didn’t want the same thing happening to me again, feeling old and outdated, so I took an online course on <span class="w-600">JavaScript</span> apps and responsive websites and rediscovered my passion for coding and make things work.</p>
                <p  class="f-14">As if it was destiny, on 2019, coding knocked on my door. I was offered the opportunity to get a significant discount in a 5 months <span class="w-600">Full Stack Web Developer</span> course. OMG! I was thrilled, but I had to pass all the programming tests to get it.
                    I was a little scared because I haven’t had coded in a while but I decided I would try my best. It took me a couple of weeks but I managed to solve every challenge, and <span class="w-600">approved</span> the admission process.
                    </p>
                <p  class="f-14">Today I’m halfway into the Full Stack course and I love it! I don’t understand why it took me so long to realise that this is <span class="w-600">what I really enjoy doing</span>: creating things and see them work!  </p>
                   <p  class="f-14">That’s why <mark class="mark-yellow-story">I'm looking for a job in web developing.</mark> I’m hungry for knowledge and I know the best way to learn is by doing. If I learned all this in my spare time <span class="w-600">imagine what I could do</span> with 9hs a day, 5 days a week! <i>(probably I learn a little more on weekends, but that’s on me ;)</i>
                    </p>
                <p  class="f-14">Hope you have enjoyed my story, that in some way you thought <span style="color:blue">#same</span> in some of the situations I depicted. I also hope you can see that <span class="w-600">I have always loved this</span> and I’m willing to <span class="w-600">start from square one</span> <i>(even though I’m already 38)</i> if that allows me to grow as a person and as a developer.</p>
